# Motivational Calendar 

## Overview
For this project, we created a calendar which displays a quote for each day selected. The user is able to view, and add additional quotes to the database if they choose. 

We used React to build out our front-end components and CSS to style. For our backend we focused on using sqlite, sequelize, and express to build a database and server.

>#### Current Project Status: 
>Currently, our team is focusing on integrating a sign-in feature where a user can tailor the calendar to their liking by adding quotes >and saving their favorites.
